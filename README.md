These are scripts that help make it possible to run an analysis solely from a bash script

1. trim_to_exact_level.py
 - use this script with the output from something like [qiimeToMaaslin](https://bitbucket.org/biobakery/qiimetomaaslin)
 - this will trim the output to an exact level of your choosing
1. heatmap.R
 - use this from the command line to make heatmaps using one category of your choosing
 - uses the output from transpose.py as included with [Maaslin](https://bitbucket.org/biobakery/maaslin/)


- Some things to note:
 - I will try to get some examples up soon
 - I have only tested these with my data - they have worked so far, but if there is an issue, post it
 - You can contact me [here](http://geoffrosen.com/contact.html)
